The E-Learning Platform UI is a simple yet effective web-based interface designed to provide a seamless learning experience. It is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to use. The platform consists of multiple pages, including a **Home Page** that introduces users to the platform and a Course Page that contains course materials, progress tracking, and an embedded video for learning.

### **1. HTML Structure**  
The **HTML file** serves as the backbone of the e-learning platform. It contains a **navigation bar** at the top, allowing users to switch between different sections of the platform. Clicking on the navigation links changes the visible page without reloading the entire website, creating a **smooth user experience**.  

The **Home Page** welcomes users and provides a brief description of the platform's purpose. It encourages learners to explore available courses and track their progress.  

The **Course Page** contains a course title, description, and progress tracking. It also includes an **embedded video**, making it easier for students to watch lectures directly within the platform.  

### **2. CSS Styling**  
The **CSS file** is responsible for styling the entire platform. It ensures a modern and clean design by using a **light background**, well-structured sections, and a visually appealing **progress bar**.  

- The **navigation bar** is styled to be simple yet effective, with links that change the displayed content when clicked.  
- The **progress bar** is an important element that provides **real-time feedback** on the user's learning progress. It consists of a gray background with a blue bar inside that grows based on progress.  
- The **layout is responsive**, meaning it adapts well to different screen sizes, making the platform accessible on **mobile, tablet, and desktop devices**.  

### **3. JavaScript Functionality**  
The **JavaScript file** makes the platform dynamic and interactive. It includes functions for **switching between pages**, **updating progress**, and **simulating progress tracking**.  
### **4. User Experience & Benefits**  
This **E-Learning Platform UI** offers multiple benefits:  

- **Easy Navigation** – Users can switch between pages without refreshing the site.  
- **Progress Tracking** – Learners can see their course completion percentage in real time.  
- **Embedded Video** – Course videos can be played directly within the platform.  
- **Scalability** – The platform can be expanded with features like quizzes, login authentication, and certificates.  

Overall, this UI provides a **solid foundation** for an e-learning platform that can be enhanced with additional functionalities in the future.
